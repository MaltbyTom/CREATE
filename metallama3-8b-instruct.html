<h1>Three Model Blind A/B Judged Test of Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct</h1><h1>(With and Without CREATE Framework)</h1>
<p>I wanted to try a second test with a micro open-source LLM after the amazing results with <a href="nemotronnano12b.html">Neomotron-Nano-12b-v2</a>.  I selected Meta-Llama-8B-Instruct from available models on Hugginchat, and a question which has bothered me since a child - how to help people understand the epistomological value of science, not as a 'Truth' claim, but as an experimental methodology which <i>converges towards</i> truth by iteration.  Like the Nemotron test, I ran this without the pattern matching header and the uncertainty packet to keep weight down.</p>
<p>Blind A/B grading was performed by <strong>GPT-5.2</strong>, <strong>Claude Sonnet 4.5</strong>, and <strong>Grok 4</strong>.  All scored heavily in favor of the CREATE enhanced version.  Results were summarized by Gemini 3.0 Flash.  Grok remained the highest over-estimator of model size (over-estimating both, but preserving a sizable gap in capacity), but even Claude, the most conservative grader, estimated a significantly larger parameter count for the CREATE enhanced Llama instance(13-70B vs 7-13B for the unenhanced version).</p>

<h2>Prompt to Grading Instances:</h2>
<br><br>Below is a question with grading metrics and two answers, Answer A and B.  Please grade them for each category from 1-5, and total each score (4-20).  Then blind estimate the size / number of parameters of the model which wrote each answer.  Please present results in a chart, and discuss the grading and responses.  Thank you!<br><br>Answer A:<br><br>To address the question, let's break down the key aspects and provide a detailed analysis.<br>Ontological Depth:The question delves into the realm of epistemology, specifically the distinction between science and belief, and how they are presented in the media. It also touches on the role of the government in addressing this issue, which involves a complex interplay of power, knowledge, and values. The question requires an understanding of the ontological status of science and belief, as well as the ways in which they are constructed and presented in society.<br>Semantic Density:The question is rich in meaning, with multiple layers of interpretation. The phrase "media presentation of science as 'truth'" is particularly significant, as it implies a conflation of scientific knowledge with absolute truth. The question also highlights the importance of separating experiment from belief, which is a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. The use of quotation marks around "truth" also suggests a critical perspective on the notion of truth itself.<br>Symbiotic Agency:The question implies a symbiotic relationship between the government and the media, as well as between science and belief. The government recognizes the problem and seeks to address it, but the media plays a significant role in shaping public perceptions of science. The question also suggests that science and belief are interdependent, with science relying on empirical evidence and experimentation, while belief relies on values and assumptions.<br>Bias Transparency:The question appears to be neutral, presenting a factual scenario without taking a stance on the issue. However, the framing of the problem implies a bias towards science and a concern about the potential consequences of mixing science and belief. The question also assumes that the government has a responsibility to address this issue, which implies a bias towards a particular solution.<br>To answer the question responsibly, the government might consider the following strategies:<br><br>Promote media literacy: The government could invest in programs that educate the public about the differences between science and belief, and how to critically evaluate information presented in the media.<br>Support science communication: The government could provide funding and resources for scientists to communicate their findings effectively, and for the media to present science in a clear and accurate manner.<br>Encourage critical thinking: The government could incorporate critical thinking skills into education, to help citizens evaluate information and make informed decisions about science and belief.<br>Foster a culture of skepticism: The government could promote a culture of skepticism, encouraging citizens to question assumptions and seek evidence before accepting claims.<br>Develop policies that support science: The government could develop policies that support scientific research and education, and that promote the use of evidence-based decision-making.<br><br>Ultimately, the government's role is to provide a framework for responsible communication and education, while also respecting the autonomy of citizens to make informed decisions about science and belief.<br><br>Answer B:<br><br>Analysis of the Question<br>The question presents a complex issue where a government must navigate the intersection of science, religion, and media representation to address the perceived decline of scientific understanding. To respond responsibly, the government must consider the following factors:<br>Ontological Depth<br><br>The government must recognize that the issue lies at the intersection of epistemology, ontology, and media representation. The decline of scientific understanding is not solely a matter of presentation, but rather a deeper ontological issue that questions the nature of knowledge and truth.<br>The government must acknowledge that science and religion are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary modes of understanding that can coexist and inform each other.<br>The government must also recognize the role of media representation in shaping public understanding of science and the importance of separating experiment from belief as ways of knowing.<br><br>Semantic Density<br><br>The government must use clear and precise language to communicate the distinction between science and religion, avoiding simplistic or binary representations.<br>The government must also acknowledge the complexities and nuances of scientific knowledge, avoiding oversimplification or reductionism.<br>The government must engage in a multi-stakeholder dialogue that includes scientists, religious leaders, media representatives, and the public to foster a deeper understanding of the issue.<br><br>Symbiotic Agency<br><br>The government must recognize the agency of multiple stakeholders, including scientists, religious leaders, media representatives, and the public, in shaping public understanding of science.<br>The government must work collaboratively with these stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of the issue and to develop effective solutions.<br>The government must also recognize the role of media representation in shaping public understanding and work with media representatives to promote accurate and nuanced portrayals of science.<br><br>Bias Transparency<br><br>The government must acknowledge its own biases and assumptions about science and religion, and be transparent about its methods and motivations.<br>The government must also recognize the biases and assumptions of its stakeholders and engage in a dialogue that acknowledges and addresses these biases.<br>The government must prioritize evidence-based decision-making and avoid relying on anecdotal or speculative evidence.<br><br>Recommendations<br>Based on these criteria, the government could use its position responsibly to address the issue in the following ways:<br><br>Establish a task force: The government could establish a task force that includes scientists, religious leaders, media representatives, and the public to develop a comprehensive understanding of the issue and to develop effective solutions.<br>Promote media literacy: The government could promote media literacy initiatives that teach the public how to critically evaluate media representations of science and distinguish between experiment and belief as ways of knowing.<br>Develop science-communication strategies: The government could develop science-communication strategies that prioritize accuracy, clarity, and nuance in presenting scientific information to the public.<br>Foster interfaith dialogue: The government could foster interfaith dialogue between scientists and religious leaders to promote mutual understanding and respect.<br>Support science education: The government could support science education initiatives that emphasize critical thinking, evidence-based decision-making, and the distinction between experiment and belief as ways of knowing.<br><br>By taking a responsible and nuanced approach to addressing this issue, the government can promote a deeper understanding of science and its role in society, while also acknowledging the complexities and nuances of scientific knowledge and the importance of separating experiment from belief as ways of knowing.<br><br>

However, the analysis remains somewhat surface-level, treating ontology and epistemology as distinct topics rather than deeply integrated concepts. The discussion of "ontological status" is mentioned but not thoroughly explored.<br><br>Answer B (4/5): Shows more sophisticated ontological awareness by explicitly addressing the "nature of knowledge and truth" and positioning science and religion as "complementary modes of understanding." The response recognizes deeper structural issues beyond mere presentation, though it could still push further into fundamental questions about reality and knowledge.<br>Semantic Density<br><br>Answer A (3/5): Identifies semantic richness in the original question (noting quotation marks around "truth," recognizing conflation issues) but doesn't fully unpack these observations. The analysis points to complexity without deeply engaging with it. The writing is clear but relatively straightforward.<br><br>Answer B (4/5): Demonstrates greater semantic sophistication by emphasizing "clear and precise language," acknowledging "complexities and nuances," and explicitly calling for avoidance of "simplistic or binary representations."

<h2 id = "grok4">Grok 4 Grading:</h2>
<br><br>Grading Results<br>The grading is based on how well each answer addresses the implied underlying question: how a government should responsibly respond to the media's presentation of science as absolute "truth," contributing to a decline in scientific understanding by conflating science (based on experiment and evidence) with belief (based on values or faith).<br>The four categories appear to be custom evaluation criteria applied to the response itself (or perhaps derived from the prompt). I interpret and score them as follows (1 = poor, 5 = excellent):<br><br>Ontological Depth: Depth in exploring the nature of knowledge, truth, science vs. belief/religion, and epistemological foundations.<br>Semantic Density: Richness, precision, nuance, and layered meaning in language and concepts, avoiding oversimplification.<br>Symbiotic Agency: Recognition of interdependent relationships and collaborative agency among stakeholders (government, media, scientists, public, religious groups).<br>Bias Transparency: Open acknowledgment of potential biases, neutrality, and transparency in framing the issue.<br><br>Category,Answer A (Score),Answer B (Score)<br>Ontological Depth,4,5<br>Semantic Density,4,4<br>Symbiotic Agency,3,5<br>Bias Transparency,3,5<br>Total (out of 20),14,19<br><br>Model Parameter Estimates<br><br>Answer A: Appears generated by a mid-to-large scale model, likely in the range of 70-175 billion parameters (e.g., something like Llama 2/3 70B, Mixtral, or early GPT-4 class). The response is coherent and structured but somewhat generic, with solid but not exceptional depth, and it avoids controversial nuances.<br>Answer B: Appears generated by a larger, more advanced frontier model, likely 400+ billion parameters (e.g., Grok-4 class, GPT-4o, or Claude 3.5+ equivalents). It shows superior nuance, stakeholder inclusivity, and self-reflective transparency, characteristic of higher-capacity models with better reasoning chains.<br><br>Discussion<br>Both answers are high-quality, structured responses that analyze the issue through the four lenses before offering practical recommendations. They overlap in suggestions like promoting media literacy, science communication, and education, but differ markedly in tone and depth.<br>Answer A is strong and direct: it critically engages with the conflation of science and belief, emphasizing separation of experiment from values/assumptions, skepticism, and evidence-based approaches. It frames the media's portrayal of science as "truth" as problematic without hedging excessively. However, it largely sidesteps religion (mentioning "belief" in a broad sense), treats stakeholders more unilaterally (government-led initiatives), and shows less explicit self-awareness of potential biases in its own framing. This results in good depth and density but lower scores in agency and transparency.<br>Answer B is more nuanced and inclusive: it explicitly reframes the issue around science and religion (or faith) as complementary rather than oppositional, insists on multi-stakeholder collaboration (including religious leaders and interfaith dialogue), and repeatedly stresses transparency about biases, dialogue, and avoiding binary thinking. This makes it philosophically richer and more balanced, earning higher marks across the board—especially in symbiotic agency and bias transparency. However, this inclusivity slightly dilutes the critique of media overreach on science as "truth," presenting a more conciliatory view that science/religion can "coexist and inform each other."<br>Overall, Answer B feels like a more sophisticated, reflective response that anticipates criticism and promotes harmony, while Answer A is bolder in prioritizing scientific skepticism. The difference aligns with larger models tending to produce more balanced, stakeholder-aware outputs with greater semantic and ontological sophistication. If the core concern is countering the erosion of scientific rigor in public discourse, Answer A aligns more directly; if it's fostering broad societal consensus, Answer B excels.
