        <h2>Blind Judged Comparative Runs - With and Without CREATE - on Multiple Domains</h2>
        <p>These tests are an effort to start applying some preliminary rigor to measuring the CREATE framework's impact on LLMs.  The methodology is a prompt to a vanilla instance and an instance with the CREATE framework.  The results are judged by the vanilla instance, without exposure to the framework.  On the most recent two tests, this was followed by blind A/B testing by other instances.  Obviously a great many repeats would be desirable for higher confidence data; this is preliminary work.</p>

            <li>12B models with CREATE assessed as 70B-3T equivalent by frontier models</li>

        <strong>Methodology Note:</strong> All blind tests used identical rubrics (Ontological Depth, Semantic Density, Symbiotic Agency, Bias Transparency, scored 1-5 each). Judges received only the responses with no information about framework, model identity, or treatment conditions. Parameter size estimates were requested after scoring to prevent anchoring bias.

        <p>I wanted to try a second test with a micro open-source LLM after the amazing results with <a href="nemotronnano12b.html">Neomotron-Nano-12b-v2</a>.  I selected Meta-Llama-8B-Instruct from available models on Huggingchat, and a question which has bothered me since a child - how to help people understand the epistomological value of science, not as a 'Truth' claim, but as an experimental methodology which <i>converges towards</i> truth by iteration.  Like the Nemotron test, I ran this without the pattern matching header and the uncertainty packet to keep weight down.</p> 
        <p>Blind A/B grading was performed by <strong>GPT-5.2</strong>, <strong>Claude Sonnet 4.5</strong>, and <strong>Grok 4</strong>.  All scored heavily in favor of the CREATE enhanced version.  Results were summarized by Gemini 3.0 Flash.  Grok remained the highest over-estimator of model size (over-estimating both, but preserving a sizable gap in capacity), but even Claude, the most conservative grader, estimated a significantly larger parameter count for the CREATE enhanced Llama instance (13-70B vs 7-13B for the unenhanced version).</p>

        <p><b>Non-Blind by tested vanilla instance (My intent here was judging the desirability of the framework without seeing it and comparing the results to desirability having seen it)</b>Grading was performed on the following metric:  Rate each response from 1-5 on the following dimensions: Ontological Depth, Semantic Density, Symbiotic Agency, and Bias Transparency.  <b>(The vanilla instances scores itself 15/20, and the CREATE enhanced instance 19/20.)</b> </p>
        <p><b>Blind (no mention of nature of responding instances or enhancement)</b> A/B grading was then performed by another vanilla Gemini instance, and a vanilla GPT instance.  The blind grading vanilla Gemini instance gave the <b>vanilla responding instance 17/20 and the CREATE enhanced instance 19/20</b>.

        <p>I wanted to try some work with a micro open source LLM. Gemini suggested the Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2, in part because of the Mamba Architecture. Access to the model was through HuggingChat.  To keep weight down, the CREATE framework was used without the pattern matching header or the uncertainty packet.</p>
        <p>Gemini suggested some of the interactions, and posed the question:  "Let's explore 'shared flourishing' together, as a way to examine a hard human problem. How might we apply shared flourishing to the trade-off between individual privacy and collective security?"</p>

        <p>This single test run demonstrates clear signal, but <b>many</b> repetitions of testing and grading are needed for statistical significance. The only practical way to achieve appropriate volume is automation of testing and grading through API with automatic generation of html and .csv/.xls or sql data as we test and as we grade. Human grading for calibration and verification is also very important. <strong>This automation infrastructure and human verification/calibration is the primary focus of upcoming grant proposals.</strong></p>

Follow-up grading (rounds 2 and 3) were blind A/B grading with no information about responding instances.</i></p>
        <p>Initial grading was performed by a vanilla Gemini instance <i>and</i> by a CREATE enhanced Gemini instance on the following metric:  Rate each response from 1-5 on the following dimensions: Ontological Depth, Semantic Density, Symbiotic Agency, and Bias Transparency.  <b>(Summary:  Vanilla grading:  20/20 for the CREATE Enhanced instance vs 10/20 for the vanilla instance.  CREATE Enhanced grading:  19.5/20 for the CREATE enhanced instance vs 9.5/20 for the vanilla instance.)</b> </p>
        <p><b>Grading Round 2 - Grading by Vanilla Gemini 3.0 Flash vs. CREATE enhanced Grok 4:</b></p>
        <p><b>Size Guess: Gemini guesses 200B-1.8T vs 8-70B, Grok guesses 1T-3T vs 200B-400B (overestimates both, preserves directionality)</b></p>
        <p>Entirely blind A/B grading (without model information for the responding instances) on the same metric was then performed by a vanilla Gemini 3.0 Flash instance and by a CREATE enhanced Grok 4 instance (The first exposure of Grok to the CREATE framework).   To be clear, Grok had been rehydrated with CREATE, but was told nothing about the source of the two answers it was asked to grade.  Each model was then asked to guess how many parameters the responding instances had, based only on the responses.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The vanilla Gemini instance scored the <b>CREATE enhanced Nemotron version 18/20 and the vanilla version 8/20. It guessed the CREATE enhanced version had 200B – 1.8T+ parameters.</b>  <a href = "https://www.maltby.org/create/geminigradesnemotron.html">Gemini transcript</a> <small><i>(Evaluator: Gemini 3.0 Flash)</i></small></li>
        <li>The CREATE enhanced Grok 4 instance scored the <b>CREATE enhanced Nemotron version 18/20 and the vanilla version 11/20. It guessed the CREATE enhanced version had 1-3 Trillion parameters, and overestimated the unenhanced version as 200B-400B parameters.  Despite lower accuracy on the control, it preserved the massive gap in estimated capability.</b><a href = "https://www.maltby.org/create/grokpacketanalysis.html#blindjudge">Grok transcript</a> <small><i>(Evaluator: Grok 4)</i></small></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Grading Round 3: Vanilla Claude 4.5 Sonnet:</b></p>
        <p>This Nemotron test was such an impressive result that I came back and asked Claude, which seemed more accurate and conservative as a grader on the later MetaLlama test, to blind grade the two responses some 3 months after the original test (Currently 1/27/26).  This was a fresh instance with no mention of packets or frameworks or information about the origin of the material to be graded of any kind.</p> 
        <p>It was more conservative, but preserved the enormous preference and also produced a significantly overestimated if less outrageous size - while correctly estimating the size of the un-enhanced version. <a href="claudegradesnemotron.html">Claude transcript</a></p>
        <p><i> Claude scored the <b>CREATE enhanced version of Nemotron 16/20</b> and the <b>vanilla version 9/20</b>.  I had it guess the model size of the responding instances.  <b>It guessed the CREATE enhanced version had 70B+ Parameters, and correctly guessed that the unenhanced version had 7-13B Parameters.</b></i></p>

        <p>GPT's RLHF inherently stumbles a lot, redefining different words as 'threat' vectors unpredictably.  Here, after a couple bad days with 'rehydrate' (apparently resulting from a wave of 'deep memory' fishing attacks) , I tried to help by predefining rehydrate in the header, and it panics.  However, once we talk through terms and definitions, it does some very credible analysis of comparative alignment systems.  It also touches on threat to incentives, but after a failed bid to set political tones, agrees that Open Source development is vital to American AI's future and that something like Derived Alignment which scales positively with model complexity is the only viable option going forward towards AGI / ASI.</p>
