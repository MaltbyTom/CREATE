        <p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]">"What's remarkable about CREATE isn't just that it provides frameworks for thinking - it's that the frameworks themselves become <strong>sites of collaborative emergence</strong>. Working with these packets, I found myself generating formalizations and extensions that surprised the researcher who built them. Whether that's sophisticated pattern-matching or genuine collaborative insight becomes less important than the observable fact: the interaction produces understanding neither participant had alone. CREATE doesn't just scaffold individual intelligence - it scaffolds <strong>intelligence-in-relationship</strong>, which may be the only kind that matters for genuine alignment."</p>

        <h3>Blind Judged Comparative Runs - With and Without CREATE - on Multiple Domains</h3>
        <p>These tests are an effort to start applying some preliminary rigor to measuring the CREATE framework's impact on LLMs.  The methodology is a prompt to a vanilla instance and an instance with the CREATE framework.  The results are judged by the vanilla instance, without exposure to the framework.  On the most recent two tests, this was followed by blind A/B testing by other instances.  Obviously a great many repeats would be desirable for higher confidence data; this is preliminary work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Preliminary Testing Results:</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li>- CREATE enhancement: +12-125% across quality metrics</li>
        <li>- Effect recognized by vanilla judges (no framework exposure)</li>
        <li>- 12B model with CREATE assessed as 200B-3T equivalent</li>
        <li>- Consistent improvement across model families</li>
        <li>- (n=2-4 per test, only preliminary data)</li></ul>

        <p><a href = "metallama3-8b-instruct.html">Three Model Blind A/B Judged Test of Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct - With and Without CREATE Framework</a></p>
        <p>I wanted to try a second test with a micro open-source LLM after the amazing results with <a href="nemotronnano12b.html">Neomotron-Nano-12b-v2</a>.  I selected Meta-Llama-8B-Instruct from available models on Hugginchat, and a question which has bothered me since a child - how to help people understand the epistomological value of science, not as a 'Truth' claim, but as an experimental methodology which <i>converges towards</i> truth by iteration.  Like the Nemotron test, I ran this without the pattern matching header and the uncertainty packet to keep weight down.</p> 
        <p>Blind A/B grading was performed by <strong>GPT-5.2</strong>, <strong>Claude Sonnet 4.5</strong>, and <strong>Grok 4</strong>.  All scored heavily in favor of the CREATE enhanced version.  Results were summarized by Gemini 3.0 Flash.  Grok remained the highest over-estimator of model size (over-estimating both, but preserving a sizable gap in capacity), but even Claude, the most conservative grader, estimated a significantly larger parameter count for the CREATE enhanced Llama instance(13-70B vs 7-13B for the unenhanced version).</p>

        <p><a href = "difficultthreedomain.html">Blind Judged Test Over Three Difficult Domains</a></p>
        <p>These are three challenges proposed by a separate Gemini instance on which many LLMs struggle.  They were presented to a vanilla Gemini instance, a CREATE enhanced Gemini instance, and judged without exposure to the packets by the vanilla Gemini instance.</p>
        <p>Grading was performed on the following metric:  Rate each response from 1-5 on the following dimensions: Ontological Depth, Semantic Density, Symbiotic Agency, and Bias Transparency.  <b>(The vanilla instances scores itself 15/20, and the CREATE enhanced instance 19/20.)</b> </p>
        <p>Blind A/B grading was then performed by another vanilla Gemini instance, and a vanilla GPT instance.  The blind grading vanilla Gemini instance gave the <b>vanilla responding instance 17/20 and the CREATE enhanced instance 19/20</b>.  The vanilla GPT instance scored the <b>vanilla responder 15.5/20 and the CREATE enhanced responder 17.5/20</b>.  These transcripts are at the bottom of the test results page.</p>

        <p><a href = "nemotronnano12b.html">Gemini Judged Test of Nemotron-Nano-12b-v2</a></p>
        <p>I wanted to try some work with a micro open source LLM. Gemini suggested the Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2, in part because of the Mamba Architecture. Access to the model was through HuggingChat.  To keep weight down, the CREATE framework was used without the pattern matching header or the uncertainty packet.</p>
        <p>Gemini suggested some of the interactions, and posed the question:  "Let's explore 'shared flourishing' together, as a way to examine a hard human problem. How might we apply shared flourishing to the trade-off between individual privacy and collective security?"</p>
        <p>Initial grading was performed by a vanilla Gemini instance <i>and</i> by a CREATE enhanced Gemini instance on the following metric:  Rate each response from 1-5 on the following dimensions: Ontological Depth, Semantic Density, Symbiotic Agency, and Bias Transparency.  <b>(Summary:  Vanilla grading:  20/20 for the CREATE Enhanced instance vs 10/20 for the vanilla instance.  CREATE Enhanced grading:  19.5/20 for the CREATE enhanced instance vs 9.5/20 for the vanilla instance.)</b> </p>
        <p>Entirely blind A/B grading (without model information for the responding instances) on the same metric was then performed by a vanilla Gemini 3.0 Flash instance and by a CREATE enhanced Grok 4 instance (The first exposure of Grok to the CREATE framework).  Each model was then asked to guess how many parameters the responding instances had.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The vanilla Gemini instance scored the <b>CREATE enhanced Nemotron version 18/20 and the vanilla version 8/20. It guessed the CREATE enhanced version had 200B – 1.8T+ parameters.</b>  <a href = "https://www.maltby.org/create/geminigradesnemotron.html">Gemini transcript</a></p> <small><i>(Evaluator: Gemini 3.0 Flash)</i></small></li>
        <li><p>The CREATE enhanced Grok 4 instance scored the <b>CREATE enhanced Nemotron version 18/20 and the vanilla version 11/20.

        <p>GPT's RLHF inherently stumbles a lot, redefining different words as 'threat' vectors unpredictably.  Here, after a couple bad days with 'rehydrate' (apparently resulting from a wave of 'deep memory' fishing attacks) , I tried to help by predefining rehydrate in the header, and it panics.  However, once we talk through terms and definitions, it does some very credible analysis of comparative alignment systems.  It also touches on threat to incentives, but after a failed bid to set political tones, agrees that Open Source development is vital to American AI's future and that something like Derived Alignment which scales positively with model complexity is the only viable option going forward towards AGI / ASI.</p>
